## What was the purpose of this project ?

I work as a Salesforce integrator and got stuck out of an organisation because I was logging in with someone else's account and they were on vacation so I had no access to the email verification code. So I started to look for a solution and found this https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F00000008oy0IAA

I am aware of the IP ranges whitelisting but since I am working remotly and in different places it's not a fitting solution. Plus this is just supposed to be an 'if all else fails' solution

Finally after a very basic solution I started improving the form with many features for learning purposes
